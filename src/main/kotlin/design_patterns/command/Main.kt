/**
 * Command design pattern
 *
 * Description:
 * This pattern allows to decouple a class which invoke some operation form a class which handle this operation.
 *
 * This allows the next features:
 * 1) Provide additional arguments to operation
 * 2) Redo / Undo operation
 * 3) Delay or schedule operation
 * 4) Process operation as a message in a queue
 * 5) Pass operation as a function argument
 *
 * Definition: Turn a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request
