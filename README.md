# KotlinExamples

This repository contains samples in Kotlin which demonstrates its main features, syntax, best practices and coding style.
The examples are what I consider to be helpful for me. Probably, this might be helpful for someone else.

Some examples are taken from the "Kotlin in action" book, which I am currently studying. 

Currently, it has 3 topic:

1. **src/main/kotlin/lesson1_hello_world_sample** - hello-world sample.
2. **src/main/kotlin/lesson2_classes_sample** - classes.
3. **src/main/kotlin/lesson3_statements_sample** statements and operators.
4. **src/main/kotlin/lesson4_exceptions** exceptions.

The list is going to be updated and extended.
