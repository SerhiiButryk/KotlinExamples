# KotlinExamples

This repository contains sample in Kotlin which demonstrates it's main features, syntax, best practices and coding style.
The examples are what I consider to be helpful for me. Probably, this might be helpful for someone else.

Some example are taken from the "Kotlin in action" book, which I am currently studing. 

Currently it has 3 topic:

1. [Add location] - hello-world sample.
2. [Add location] - classes.
3. [Add location] - statements and operators.

The list is going to be updated and extended.
